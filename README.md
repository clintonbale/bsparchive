# bsparchive

A tool used to backup the `maps` directory of GoldSrc engine games by
finding all dependencies for each bsp file and zipping them up into individual
archives.

## Usage

Overview of options below:

```
Usage: bsparchive [-hvVdns] [-g <PATH>] [-o <PATH>] <PATH>
Identifies and archives all dependencies for bsp files.

  -h, --help                print this help and exit
  -v, --verbose             verbose output
  -V, --version             print version information and exit
  -d, --justdeps            output only the list of dependencies for the input bsp
  -n, --nooverwrite         dont overwrite zip files in the output directory
  -s, --noexclude           files in exclusion list are included
  -g, --gamedir=<PATH>      the game directory
  -o, --output=<PATH>       where to output the zip files
  <PATH>                    bsp file or map directories
```

Example usage:

`bsparchive.exe -o output "C:\Games\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life\tfc\maps"`

Outputs the archived zip files containing required dependencies for all the bsp files
in the tfc maps folder to the `output` folder in the current directory.

## Limitations

* Only bsp version 30 files are supported. (GoldSrc)
* Excludes all out of the box game files for all games
  * This means when archiving `tfc` maps, all resources from `cstrike` will be
    excluded from the archive even if the `tfc` maps depend on them.
